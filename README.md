#ABSTRACT
The deleterious impacts of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection endure considerably, with particular concern on peri-/pre-conceptional infections due to owing to their potential ramifications on gestation, yet current comprehension remains largely limited. Here, we established a retrospective-prospective cohort encompassing 847 individuals who underwent early pregnancy induced abortion during the first four months of 2022 and 2023. The assessment of blood biochemical indicators depicted a relatively heightened hypercoagulable state in women recovered from mild the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which gradually ameliorated over the recovery duration. Transcriptomic profiling of 245 villi and decidua samples from 132 individuals unveiled the pronounced anti-SARS-CoV-2 response in the group obtaining pregnancy near acute infection and the greatest alteration noted approximately two and a half months into recovery when compared to the uninfected group. With elongated recovery duration, both linear and non-linear transcriptional changes were observed but with substantial disparities between villi and decidua. Additionally, combined with single-cell transcriptomic atlas and multiparameter flow cytometry analysis, we further elucidated the dynamic profiling and potential contributions of cell subsets at the peripheral and maternal-fetal interface. In summary, our study comprehensively scrutinized the impact of peri-/pre-conceptional SARS-CoV-2 infections on peripheral blood and maternal-fetal interface in the first trimester, offering valuable reference for pregnancy planning of convalescent women of reproductive age, as well as clinical consultation and treatment of early pregnancy infections.
